# Description of choices for generating the class diagrams

### System Overview
When I generated the overview of the full system I chose to hide almost all the different attributes and details about the classes as I expected these to clutter the diagrams too much while adding little insight into the whole system. I also chose to not include the package models as the package name is already part of each class entity.

### Detailed view
I chose to create a detailed view of two parsers that exist in the system. These are the QR and the text scanner. These Class diagrams are interesting as on can see how these scanners interact with their data-models and each other. Further, the group chose to select different detailed views such that everyone would get a better insight into several parts of the system.
