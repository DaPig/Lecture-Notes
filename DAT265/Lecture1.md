Lehman made a set of empirical observation, software have to change otherwise it will not continue to be used.
As the software evolves, it will be more complex over time.
I.e. software evolution knowledge is important.

We will be exposed to a software system that is not perfect, we will have to learn it and evolve it.

Often companies spend the most of the maintenance on adaptive and perfective fixes. i.e. improve maintainability or react to changes in the software environment. Often not enough on preventive changes to prevent future problems.


Software maintenance is about 65-75% of the total effort in a software. I.e. maintenance is the most time consuming task in a softwares' lifecycle.
